This project is made by me as a part of learning process of backend development. API calls, Authentication, User creation, Database Management, Node JS and Express JS. The project does not have a very appealing front-end with no complex CSS being used. May not work on certain devices as it is not responsive, but it does implement a lot of backend libraries EJS, Mongoose, Express and also use file destructuring to break down the code in readable segments.
